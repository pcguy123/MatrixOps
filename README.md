# MatrixOps

"MatrixOps" is a program designed to allow users to create matrices and perform operations on them such as calculating dot products, determinants, and inverses.

It has been coded entirely with C and some of its standard libraries.

Fractions involving division by zero are treated as limits with the denominator approaching 0:
1/0 -> ∞
-1/0 -> -∞

Indeterminant forms are displayed as "ind":
0/0 -> ind
∞/∞ -> ind
∞-∞ -> ind
